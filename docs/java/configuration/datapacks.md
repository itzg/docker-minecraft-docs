### Enable/disable initial selection of datapacks

New to [22W42A](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-22w42a), datapacks with feature flags can be controlled before initial world creation by setting these to a comma separated list of packs:

- `INITIAL_ENABLED_PACKS`
  such as "update_1_20,bundle"
- `INITIAL_DISABLED_PACKS`
