[packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) is a CLI tool for maintaining and providing modpack definitions, with support for both CurseForge and Modrinth as sources. See the [packwiz tutorial](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/getting-started/) for more information.

To configure server mods using a packwiz modpack, set the `PACKWIZ_URL` environment variable to the location of your `pack.toml` modpack definition:

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data -e TYPE=FABRIC \
    -e "PACKWIZ_URL=https://example.com/modpack/pack.toml" \
    itzg/minecraft-server
```

packwiz modpack defitions are processed before other mod definitions (`MODPACK`, `MODS`, etc.) to allow for additional processing/overrides you may want to perform (in case of mods not available via Modrinth/CurseForge, or you do not maintain the pack).

!!! note 

    packwiz is pre-configured to only download server mods. If client-side mods are downloaded and cause issues, check your pack.toml configuration, and make sure any client-only mods are not set to `"both"`, but rather `"client"` for the side configuration item.
