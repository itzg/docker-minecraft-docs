### Running a Loliserver type server

A [Loliserver](https://github.com/Loli-Server/LoliServer) type server can be used with

    -e TYPE=LOLISERVER

!!! note

    Loliserver only provides a single release stream, so `VERSION` is ignored

!!! warning
    
    The retrieval of the serverjar is not bulletproof. It can and probably will change in the future.
