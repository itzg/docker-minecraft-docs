## Running a server with a Feed the Beast modpack

!!! note 

    Requires one of the Ubuntu with Hotspot images listed in [the Java versions section](#running-minecraft-server-on-different-java-version).

[Feed the Beast application](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) modpacks are supported by using `-e TYPE=FTBA` (**note** the "A" at the end of the type). This server type will automatically take care of downloading and installing the modpack and appropriate version of Forge, so the `VERSION` does not need to be specified.

### Environment Variables:
- `FTB_MODPACK_ID`: **required**, the numerical ID of the modpack to install. The ID can be located by [finding the modpack](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack) and locating the ID in this part of the URL:

  ```
  https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/23-ftb-infinity-evolved-17
                                          ^^
  ```
- `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID`: optional, the numerical ID of the version to install. If not specified, the latest version will be installed. The "Version ID" can be obtained by hovering over a server file entry and grabbing [this ID in the URL](../../assets/images/java/ftba-version-id-popup.png).

### Upgrading

If a specific `FTB_MODPACK_VERSION_ID` was not specified, simply restart the container to pick up the newest modpack version. If using a specific version ID, recreate the container with the new version ID.

### Example

The following example runs the latest version of [FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.12](https://ftb.neptunepowered.org/pack/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-12/):

```
docker run -d --name mc-ftb -e EULA=TRUE \
  -e TYPE=FTBA -e FTB_MODPACK_ID=31 \
  -p 25565:25565 \
  itzg/minecraft-server:java8-multiarch
```

!!! note 

    Normally you will also add `-v` volume for `/data` since the mods and config are installed there along with world data.
