### Running a Mohist server

A [Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist) server can be used with

    -e TYPE=MOHIST

!!! note 

   There are limited base versions supported, so you will also need to  set `VERSION`, such as "1.12.2"

By default the latest build will be used; however, a specific build number can be selected by setting `MOHIST_BUILD`, such as

    -e VERSION=1.16.5 -e MOHIST_BUILD=374
