    -e TYPE=PUFFERFISH

!!! note

    The `VERSION` variable is used to select branch latest, 1.18, or 1.17. Use PUFFERFISH_BUILD to really select the SERVER VERSION number.

Extra variables:
- `PUFFERFISH_BUILD=lastSuccessfulBuild` : set a specific Pufferfish build to use. Example: selecting build 47 => 1.18.1, or build 50 => 1.18.2 etc
- `FORCE_REDOWNLOAD=false` : set to true to force the located server jar to be re-downloaded
- `USE_FLARE_FLAGS=false` : set to true to add appropriate flags for the built-in [Flare](https://blog.airplane.gg/flare) profiler
